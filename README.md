    • A centralized server keeps track of which clients are connected and storing what pieces of files.
    • Through tracker protocol, a client informs the server as to what files are contained in its local 
      repository but does not actually transmit file data to the server.
    • When a client requires a file that does not belong to its repository, a request is sent to the 
      server.
    • Multiple clients could be downloading different files from a target client at a given point in 
      time. This requires the client code to be multithreaded
